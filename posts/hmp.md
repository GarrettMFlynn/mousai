# Hippocampal Memory Prosthesis
## Introduction
[user story + illustration]

## How the Device Device
The **Hippocampal Memory Prosthesis (HMP)** is a proof-of-concept system 
to deliver precise spatiotemporal patterns of stimulation 
to hippocampal neurons in human epilepsy patients 
and significantly improve short/long-term memory formation. 

We are collaborating with the USC Center for Neural Engineering
and the neuroethics thrust at the UW Center for Neurotechnology
to incorporate user feedback into HMP design.
