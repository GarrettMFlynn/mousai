# Hippocampal Memory Prosthesis (HMP)
The HMP is a proof-of-concept system 
that delivers precise patterns of electrical stimulation 
to the brains of human epilepsy patients and significantly improves memory formation. 

We are collaborating with the USC Center for Neural Engineering
and the neuroethics thrust at the UW Center for Neurotechnology
to incorporate user feedback into the future design of 
memory neurotechnologiesâ€”including the HMP.
